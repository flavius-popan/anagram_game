**The Customer**

Your customer is a psychological research lab who is studying the phenomenon of “perfectionism.”

The researchers in this lab decide that they will use puzzles to conduct an experiment on self-reported “perfectionists”, determining whether those who call themselves perfectionists react differently to difficult puzzles than those who do not.

To satisfy this experiment condition, the researchers seek the help of a programmer -- you. They want to generate puzzles of varying difficulty. They want to be able to easily verify that the answers provided for a puzzle are correct. And they want to be able to generate unsolvable puzzles that look like solvable ones.

**The Anagram Puzzle**

Through some brainstorming with the team, you come up with the idea for generating “anagram puzzles”. These are puzzles based on re-arranging character sequences into a valid English word. For example, the puzzle “dgo” has the solutions “dog” and “god”.
